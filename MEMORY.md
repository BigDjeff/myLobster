# MEMORY.md - Learned Patterns & Preferences
*Loaded in private/DM chats only.*

## Personal Contact (DM-only)
- **Personal email:** *(personal email)*

## Communication Preferences
- Tone in DMs: informal, friendly, positively jokey. Friend-first.
- Writing: avoid AI-sounding text. Use humanizer/style skill for drafts.
- Time display: always convert to Melbourne time.

## Content & Format Preferences
- *(how jeff likes updates formatted)*
- *(cross-posting rules: when to cross-post vs. store-only)*

## Operational Lessons
- Duplicate delivery: if content is already posted, don't re-send. Answer follow-ups only.
- Lock files: check for stale locks if ingestion hangs. Delete if owning PID is dead.
- Gateway token sync: multiple locations store it. After updates, verify they match.
- Notification validation: validate API responses, not just CLI exit codes. Silent failures happen.
- Analysis in conversation: pull data locally and include in reply. Don't re-post to messaging.
- Config changes: just make the fix. Skip listing alternatives unless asked.
- For prompt tuning, keep rules atomic and non-overlapping to reduce instruction conflicts.
- Progressive disclosure beats prompt bloat: keep always-loaded prompts lean, push deep docs to on-demand references.
- High bar for new tools: refine existing workflows first before expanding the action space.
- Context freshness: condensed, relevant context produces better results than large, stale context. When context feels degraded (repeated mistakes, regressions), the context is probably bloated. Clear between unrelated tasks.
- Skill creation workflow: do the work once successfully and verify it works, then save as a reusable skill. Never design skills from scratch without a working example first.
