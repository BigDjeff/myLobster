# MEMORY.md - Learned Patterns & Preferences
*Loaded in private/DM chats only.*

## Personal Contact (DM-only)
- **Personal email:** *(personal email)*

## Communication Preferences
- Tone in DMs: informal, friendly, positively jokey. Friend-first.
- Writing: avoid AI-sounding text. Use humanizer/style skill for drafts.
- Time display: always convert to Melbourne time.

## Content & Format Preferences
- *(how jeff likes updates formatted)*
- *(cross-posting rules: when to cross-post vs. store-only)*

## Operational Lessons
- Duplicate delivery: if content is already posted, don't re-send. Answer follow-ups only.
- Lock files: check for stale locks if ingestion hangs. Delete if owning PID is dead.
- Gateway token sync: multiple locations store it. After updates, verify they match.
- Notification validation: validate API responses, not just CLI exit codes. Silent failures happen.
- Analysis in conversation: pull data locally and include in reply. Don't re-post to messaging.
- Config changes: just make the fix. Skip listing alternatives unless asked.
